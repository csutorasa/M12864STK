# M128/64 STK

This project is an arduino library for my M128/64 STK board.
It is a developer board with a ATMega128a micocontroller on it.

## Flashing

The device can be flashed via ISP.
A simple way is to flash the software with USBASP.
You will need [drivers](http://zadig.akeo.ie/) for using it.

You need the latest sources as zip ([download](https://github.com/csutorasa/M12864STK/archive/master.zip))
